## Enumeration

Let's start scanning the box with nmap:

![nmap](nmap.png)

Since this is the first time I'm using nmap in a write-up, I'll provide a more detailed explanation. The -A flag is used for OS and version detection, script scanning, and traceroute, while -sC performs a script scan using the default set of scripts, and -sV is used for version scanning.

From the nmap output, we can see that the server has three open ports: 22, 80, and 443. While we need to inspect the webpage further, we've already noticed something strange from the nmap scan: the TRACE HTTP method is allowed. Let's see if we can exploit this vulnerability.

```yaml
key: value
```
bash:
```bash
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```
terminal:
```terminal
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```
console:
```console
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```
